<dd>"GPL" stands for "General Public License".  The most widespread such
license is the GNU General Public License, or GNU GPL for short.  This
can be further shortened to "GPL", when it is understood that the GNU
GPL is the one intended.
<p></p></dd>

<dt><b><a href="#TOCDoesFreeSoftwareMeanUsingTheGPL" name="DoesFreeSoftwareMeanUsingTheGPL">
Does free software mean using the GPL?</a></b></dt>

<dd>
Not at all--there are many other free software licenses.  We have an
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html"> incomplete
list</a>.  Any license that provides the user <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">certain specific
freedoms</a> is a free software license.
<p></p></dd>

<dt><b><a href="#TOCWhyUseGPL" name="WhyUseGPL">
Why should I use the GNU GPL rather than other free software licenses?</a></b></dt>

<dd>
Using the GNU GPL will require that all the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/pragmatic.html">released improved versions be free
software</a>.  This means you can avoid the risk of having to compete
with a proprietary modified version of your own work.  However, in
some special situations it can be better to use a
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html"> more permissive license</a>.

<dt><b><a href="#TOCDoesAllGNUSoftwareUseTheGNUGPLAsItsLicense" name="DoesAllGNUSoftwareUseTheGNUGPLAsItsLicense">
Does all GNU software use the GNU GPL as its license?</a></b></dt>

<dd>
Most GNU software packages use the GNU GPL, but there are a few
GNU programs (and parts of programs) that use looser licenses, such as the
Lesser GPL.  When we do this, it is a matter of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html"> strategy</a>.
<p></p></dd>

<dt><b><a href="#TOCDoesUsingTheGPLForAProgramMakeItGNUSoftware" name="DoesUsingTheGPLForAProgramMakeItGNUSoftware">
Does using the GPL for a program make it GNU software?</a></b></dt>

<dd>
Anyone can release a program under the GNU GPL but that does not
make it a GNU package.
<p>
Making the program a GNU software package means explicitly
contributing to the GNU Project.  This happens when the program's
developers and the GNU Project agree to do it.  If you are interested
in contributing a program to the GNU Project, please write to
<a href="mailto:maintainers@gnu.org">&lt;maintainers@gnu.org&gt;</a>.

<dt><b><a href="#TOCReportingViolation" name="ReportingViolation">
What should I do if I discover a possible violation of the GPL?</a></b></dt>

<dd>
You should <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-violation.html">report it.</a>
First, check the facts as best you can.  Then tell the publisher or
copyright holder of the specific GPL-covered program.  If that is the
Free Software Foundation, write to <a href="mailto:license-violation@gnu.org">&lt;license-violation@gnu.org&gt;</a>.  
Otherwise, the program's maintainer may be the copyright holder, or
else could tell you how to contact the copyright holder, so report it
to the maintainer.

A crucial aspect of free software is that users are free to cooperate.
It is absolutely essential to permit users who wish to help each other
to share their bug fixes and improvements with other users.
<p>
Some have proposed alternatives to the GPL that require modified
versions to go through the original author.  As long as the original
author keeps up with the need for maintenance, this may work well in
practice, but if the author stops (more or less) to do something else
or does not attend to all the users' needs, this scheme falls down.
Aside from the practical problems, this scheme does not allow users to
help each other.</p>
<p>
Sometimes control over modified versions is proposed as a means of
preventing confusion between various versions made by users.  In our
experience, this confusion is not a major problem.  Many versions of
Emacs have been made outside the GNU Project, but users can tell them
apart.  The GPL requires the maker of a version to place his or her
name on it, to distinguish it from other versions and to protect the
reputations of other maintainers.

The GPL does not require you to release your modified version.  You are
free to make modifications and use them privately, without ever
releasing them.  This applies to organizations (including companies),
too; an organization can make a modified version and use it internally
without ever releasing it outside the organization.
<p>
But <em>if</em> you release the modified version to the public in some
way, the GPL requires you to make the modified source code available
to the program's users, under the GPL.</p>

Thus, the GPL gives permission to release the modified program in
certain ways, and not in other ways; but the decision of whether to
release it is up to you.

"Valid for any third party" means that anyone who has the offer

If you commercially distribute binaries not accompanied with source

source code later.  When users non-commercially redistribute the
binaries they received from you, they must pass along a copy of this
written offer.  This means that people who did not get the binaries
directly from you can still receive copies of the source code, along with
the written offer.</p>

It might be tempting to include a URL that refers to the license,

The preamble and instructions add up to some 5000 characters, less

So please consider: can you find a way to get the job done without using
this library? Can you write a free replacement for that library?</p>

If the program is already written using the non-free library, perhaps it
is too late to change the decision. You may as well release the program
as it stands, rather than not release it. But please mention in the

the task of changing the program so that it does the same job without

legal issues come up if I use GPL-incompatible libraries with GPL

If the libraries that you link with fall within the following exception
in the GPL:
<blockquote><p>
     However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not
     include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or
     binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of
     the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
     component itself accompanies the executable.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
then you don't have to do anything special to use them; the requirement
to distribute source code for the whole program does not include those
libraries, even if you distribute a linked executable containing them.
Thus, if the libraries you need come with major parts of a proprietary
operating system, the GPL says people can link your program with them
without any conditions.
</p><p>       
If you want your program to link against a library not covered by that
exception, you need to add your own exception, wholly outside of the
GPL. This copyright notice and license notice give permission to link
with the program FOO:</p>

</p><p>
    In addition, as a special exception, &lt;name of copyright
    holder&gt; gives permission to link the code of this program with
    the FOO library (or with modified versions of FOO that use the
    same license as FOO), and distribute linked combinations including
    the two.  You must obey the GNU General Public License in all
    respects for all of the code used other than FOO.  If you modify
    this file, you may extend this exception to your version of the
    file, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to
    do so, delete this exception statement from your version.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Only the copyright holders for the program can legally authorize this
exception. If you wrote the whole program yourself, then assuming your
employer or school does not claim the copyright, you are the copyright
holder--so you can authorize the exception. But if you want to use parts
of other GPL-covered programs by other authors in your code, you cannot
authorize the exception for them. You have to get the approval of the
copyright holders of those programs.

When other people modify the program, they do not have to make the same

Under the Berne Convention, everything written is automatically
copyrighted from whenever it is put in fixed form.  So you don't have
to do anything to "get" the copyright on what you write--as long as
nobody else can claim to own your work.
<p>
However, registering the copyright in the US is a very good idea.  It
will give you more clout in dealing with an infringer in the US.</p>
<p>
The case when someone else might possibly claim the copyright is if
you are an employee or student; then the employer or the school might
claim you did the job for them and that the copyright belongs to them.
Whether they would have a valid claim would depend on circumstances
such as the laws of the place where you live, and on your employment
contract and what sort of work you do.  It is best to consult a lawyer
if there is any possible doubt.</p>
<p>
If you think that the employer or school might have a claim, you can
resolve the problem clearly by getting a copyright disclaimer signed
by a suitably authorized officer of the company or school.  (Your

disclaimer.)

If you see any chance that your school might refuse to allow your

more leverage.</p>

So we recommend that you approach them when the program is only

Yes, because the copyright on the editors and tools does not cover the

<p>
Some programs copy parts of themselves into the output for technical
reasons--for example, Bison copies a standard parser program into its
output file.  In such cases, the copied text in the output is covered
by the same license that covers it in the source code.  Meanwhile, the
part of the output which is derived from the program's input inherits
the copyright status of the input.</p>
<p>
As it happens, Bison can also be used to develop non-free programs.

<dd>
In general this is legally impossible; copyright law does not give you
any say in the use of the output people make from their data using
your program.  If the user uses your program to enter or convert his
own data, the copyright on the output belongs to him, not you.  More
generally, when a program translates its input into some other form,
the copyright status of the output inherits that of the input it was
generated from.
<p>
So the only way you have a say in the use of the output is if
substantial parts of the output are copied (more or less) from text in
your program.  For instance, part of the output of Bison (see above)
would be covered by the GNU GPL, if we had not made an exception in
this specific case.</p>
<p>
You could artificially make a program copy certain text into its
output even if there is no technical reason to do so.  But if that

When the interpreter just interprets a language, the answer is no.  The
interpreted program, to the interpreter, is just data; a free software
license like the GPL, based on copyright law, cannot limit what data you
use the interpreter on.  You can run it on any data (interpreted program),
any way you like, and there are no requirements about licensing that data
to anyone.
<p>However, when the interpreter is extended to provide "bindings" to
other facilities (often, but not necessarily, libraries), the
interpreted program is effectively linked to the facilities it uses
through these bindings. So if these facilities are released under the
GPL, the interpreted program that uses them must be released in a
GPL-compatible way.  The JNI or Java Native Interface is an example of
such a binding mechanism; libraries that are accessed in this way are
linked dynamically with the Java programs that call them.  These
libraries are also linked with the interpreter.  If the interpreter is
linked statically with these libraries, or if it is designed to 
<a href="#GPLPluginsInNF"> link dynamically with these specific
libraries</a>, then it too needs to be released in a GPL-compatible
way.</p>
<p>
Another similar and very common case is to provide libraries with the
interpreter which are themselves interpreted.  For instance, Perl
comes with many Perl modules, and a Java implementation comes with
many Java classes.  These libraries and the programs that call them
are always dynamically linked together.</p>
<p>
A consequence is that if you choose to use GPL'd Perl modules or Java
classes in your program, you must release the program in a
GPL-compatible way, regardless of the license used in the Perl or Java
interpreter that the combined Perl or Java program will run on.

<dt><b><a href="#TOCMereAggregation" name="MereAggregation">What is the
  difference between "mere aggregation" and "combining two modules into

<dd>
Mere aggregation of two programs means putting them side by side on
the same CD-ROM or hard disk.  We use this term in the case where they
are separate programs, not parts of a single program.  In this case,
if one of the programs is covered by the GPL, it has no effect on the
other program.
<p>
Combining two modules means connecting them together so that they form
a single larger program.  If either part is covered by the GPL, the
whole combination must also be released under the GPL--if you can't,
or won't, do that, you may not combine them.</p>
<p>
What constitutes combining two parts into one program?  This is a
legal question, which ultimately judges will decide.  We believe that
a proper criterion depends both on the mechanism of communication
(exec, pipes, rpc, function calls within a shared address space, etc.)
and the semantics of the communication (what kinds of information are
interchanged).</p>
<p>
If the modules are included in the same executable file, they are
definitely combined in one program.  If modules are designed to run
linked together in a shared address space, that almost surely means
combining them into one program.</p>
<p>
By contrast, pipes, sockets and command-line arguments are
communication mechanisms normally used between two separate programs.
So when they are used for communication, the modules normally are
separate programs.  But if the semantics of the communication are
intimate enough, exchanging complex internal data structures, that too
could be a basis to consider the two parts as combined into a larger
program.

Our lawyers have told us that to be in the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-assign.html">best position to enforce

We also ask individual contributors to get copyright disclaimers from
their employers (if any) so that we can be sure those employers won't

<p>
Of course, if all the contributors put their code in the public

<dt><b><a href="#TOCGPLInProprietarySystem" name="GPLInProprietarySystem">I'd like to incorporate GPL-covered
  software in my proprietary system.  Can I do this?</a></b></dt>

<dd>
You cannot incorporate GPL-covered software in a proprietary system.
The goal of the GPL is to grant everyone the freedom to copy,
redistribute, understand, and modify a program.  If you could
incorporate GPL-covered software into a non-free system, it would have
the effect of making the GPL-covered software non-free too.
<p>
A system incorporating a GPL-covered program is an extended version of
that program.  The GPL says that any extended version of the program
must be released under the GPL if it is released at all.  This is for
two reasons: to make sure that users who get the software get the
freedom they should have, and to encourage people to give back
improvements that they make.</p>
<p>
However, in many cases you can distribute the GPL-covered software
alongside your proprietary system.  To do this validly, you must make
sure that the free and non-free programs communicate at arms length,
that they are not combined in a way that would make them
effectively a single program.</p>
<p>
The difference between this and "incorporating" the GPL-covered
software is partly a matter of substance and partly form.  The
substantive part is this: if the two programs are combined so that
they become effectively two parts of one program, then you can't treat
them as two separate programs.  So the GPL has to cover the whole
thing.</p>
<p>
If the two programs remain well separated, like the compiler and the
kernel, or like an editor and a shell, then you can treat them as two
separate programs--but you have to do it properly.  The issue is
simply one of form: how you describe what you are doing.  Why do we
care about this?  Because we want to make sure the users clearly
understand the free status of the GPL-covered software in the
collection.</p>
<p>
If people were to distribute GPL-covered software calling it "part of"
a system that users know is partly proprietary, users might be
uncertain of their rights regarding the GPL-covered software.  But if they
know that what they have received is a free program plus another
program, side by side, their rights will be clear.

<dd>
There are two reasons for this.
<p>
First, a general one.  If we permitted company A to make a proprietary
file, and company B to distribute GPL-covered software linked with

If a program P is released under the GPL that means *any and every part of

for free software.  It means we partially abandon the attempt to
defend the users' freedom, and some of the requirements to share what
is built on top of GPL-covered software.  In themselves, those are
changes for the worse.
<p>
Sometimes a localized retreat is a good strategy.  Sometimes, using
the LGPL for a library might lead to wider use of that library, and
thus to more improvement for it, wider support for free software, and
so on.  This could be good for free software if it happens to a large
extent.  But how much will this happen?  We can only speculate.</p>
<p>
It would be nice to try out the LGPL on each library for a while, see
whether it helps, and change back to the GPL if the LGPL didn't help.
But this is not feasible.  Once we use the LGPL for a particular
library, changing back would be difficult.</p>
<p>
So we decide which license to use for each library on a case-by-case
basis.  There is a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html">
long explanation</a> of how we judge the question.

<dt><b><a href="#TOCWillYouMakeAnException" name="WillYouMakeAnException">Using a certain GNU program under the
  GPL does not fit our project to make proprietary software.  Will you
  make an exception for us?  It would mean more users of that
  program.</a></b></dt>

<dd>
Sorry, we don't make such exceptions.  It would not be right.
<p>
Maximizing the number of users is not our aim.  Rather, we are trying
to give the crucial freedoms to as many users as possible.  In
general, proprietary software projects hinder rather than help the
cause of freedom.</p>
<p>
We do occasionally make license exceptions to assist a project which
is producing free software under a license other than the GPL.
However, we have to see a good reason why this will advance the cause
of free software.</p>
<p>
We also do sometimes change the distribution terms of a package, when
that seems clearly the right way to serve the cause of free software;
but we are very cautious about this, so you will have to show us very
convincing reasons.
</p></dd>

<dt><b><a href="#TOCVersionTwoOrLater" name="VersionTwoOrLater">Why
should programs say "Version 2 of the GPL or any later version"?</a></b></dt>

<dd>
From time to time, at intervals of years, we change the GPL--sometimes
to clarify it, sometimes to permit certain kinds of use not previously
permitted, and sometimes to tighten up a requirement.  (The last
change was in 1991.)  Using this "indirect pointer" in each program
makes it possible for us to change the distribution terms on the
entire collection of GNU software, when we update the GPL.
<p>
If each program lacked the indirect pointer, we would be forced to
discuss the change at length with numerous copyright holders, which
would be a virtual impossibility.  In practice, the chance of having
uniform distribution terms for GNU software would be nil.</p>
<p>
Suppose a program says "Version 2 of the GPL or any later version" and
a new version of the GPL is released.  If the new GPL version gives
additional permission, that permission will be available immediately
to all the users of the program.  But if the new GPL version has a
tighter requirement, it will not restrict use of the current version
of the program, because it can still be used under GPL version 2.
When a program says "Version 2 of the GPL or any later version", users
will always be permitted to use it, and even change it, according to
the terms of GPL version 2--even after later versions of the GPL are
available.</p>
<p>
If a tighter requirement in a new version of the GPL need not be
obeyed for existing software, how is it useful?  Once GPL version 3 is
available, the developers of most GPL-covered programs will release
subsequent versions of their programs specifying "Version 3 of the GPL
or any later version".  Then users will have to follow the tighter
requirements in GPL version 3, for subsequent versions of the program.</p>
<p>
However, developers are not obligated to do this; developers can
continue allowing use of the previous version of the GPL, if that is
their preference.

<dt><b><a href="#TOCWhyNotGPLForManuals" name="WhyNotGPLForManuals">Why
don't you use the GPL for manuals?</a></b></dt>

<dd>
It is possible to use the GPL for a manual, but the GNU Free
Documentation License (GFDL) is much better for manuals.
<p>
The GPL was designed for programs; it contains lots of complex clauses
that are crucial for programs, but that would be cumbersome and
unnecessary for a book or manual.  For instance, anyone publishing the
book on paper would have to either include machine-readable "source
code" of the book along with each printed copy, or provide a written
offer to send the "source code" later.</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the GFDL has clauses that help publishers of free manuals
make a profit from selling copies--cover texts, for instance.  The
special rules for Endorsements sections make it possible to use the
GFDL for an official standard.  This would permit modified versions,
but they could not be labeled as "the standard".</p>
<p>
Using the GFDL, we permit changes in the text of a manual that covers
its technical topic.  It is important to be able to change the
technical parts, because people who change a program ought to change
the documentation to correspond.  The freedom to do this is an
ethical imperative.</p>
<p>
Our manuals also include sections that state our political position
about free software.  We mark these as "invariant", so that they
cannot be changed or removed.  The GFDL makes provisions for these
"invariant sections".

<dt><b><a href="#TOCFontException" name="FontException">How does the
GPL apply to fonts?</a></b></dt>

<dd>
Font licensing is a complex issue which needs serious
consideration.  The following license exception is experimental but
approved for general use.  We welcome suggestions on this subject --
please write to
<a href="mailto:licensing@gnu.org">licensing@gnu.org</a>.
<p>
To use this exception, add this text to the license notice of each
file in the package (to the extent possible), at the end of the text
that says the file is distributed under the GNU GPL:</p>
<p>
<tt>
As a special exception, if you create a document which uses
this font, and embed this font or unaltered portions of this font into
the document, this font does not by itself cause the resulting
document to be covered by the GNU General Public License.  This
exception does not however invalidate any other reasons why the
document might be covered by the GNU General Public License.  If you
modify this font, you may extend this exception to your version of the
font, but you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so,
delete this exception statement from your version.

<dt><b><a href="#TOCGPLTranslations" name="GPLTranslations">Are there
translations of the GPL into other languages?</a></b></dt>

<dd>
It would be useful to have translations of the GPL into languages
other than English.  People have even written translations and sent
them to us.  But we have not dared to approve them as officially
valid.  That carries a risk so great we do not dare accept it.
<p>
A legal document is in some ways like a program.  Translating it is
like translating a program from one language and operating system to
another.  Only a lawyer skilled in both languages can do it--and even
then, there is a risk of introducing a bug.</p>
<p>
If we were to approve, officially, a translation of the GPL, we would
be giving everyone permission to do whatever the translation says they
can do.  If it is a completely accurate translation, that is fine.
But if there is an error in the translation, the results could be a
disaster which we could not fix.</p>
<p>
If a program has a bug, we can release a new version, and eventually
the old version will more or less disappear.  But once we have given
everyone permission to act according to a particular translation, we
have no way of taking back that permission if we find, later on, that
it had a bug.</p>
<p>
Helpful people sometimes offer to do the work of translation for us.
If the problem were a matter of finding someone to do the work, this
would solve it.  But the actual problem is the risk of error, and
offering to do the work does not avoid the risk.  We could not
possibly authorize a translation written by a non-lawyer.</p>
<p>
Therefore, for the time being, we are not approving translations
of the GPL as globally valid and binding.  Instead, we are doing two
things:</p>
<ul>
<li> Referring people to unofficial translations.
This means that we permit people to write translations of the GPL, but
we don't approve them as legally valid and binding.
<p>
An unapproved translation has no legal force, and it should say so
explicitly.  It should be marked as follows:</p>
<pre>    This translation of the GPL is informal, and not officially approved
    by the Free Software Foundation as valid.  To be completely sure of
    what is permitted, refer to the original GPL (in English).
</pre>
<p>
But the unapproved translation can serve as a hint for how to
understand the English GPL.  For many users, that is sufficient.</p>
<p>
However, businesses using GNU software in commercial activity, and
people doing public ftp distribution, should need to check the real
English GPL to make sure of what it permits.</p>
</li>
<li>
Publishing translations valid for a single country only.
<p>
We are considering the idea of publishing translations which are
officially valid only for one country.  This way, if there is a
mistake, it will be limited to that country, and the damage will not
be too great.</p>
<p>
It will still take considerable expertise and effort from a sympathetic
and capable lawyer to make a translation, so we cannot promise any
such translations soon.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<dt><b><a href="#TOCInterpreterIncompat" name="InterpreterIncompat">If
a programming language interpreter has a license that is incompatible
with the GPL, can I run GPL-covered programs on it?</a></b></dt>

<dd>
When the interpreter just interprets a language, the answer is yes.
The interpreted program, to the interpreter, is just data; the GPL
doesn't restrict what tools you process the program with.
<p>
However, when the interpreter is extended to provide "bindings" to
other facilities (often, but not necessarily, libraries), the
interpreted program is effectively linked to the facilities it uses
through these bindings.  The JNI or Java Native Interface is an
example of such a facility; libraries that are accessed in this way
are linked dynamically with the Java programs that call them.</p>
<p>
So if these facilities are released under a GPL-incompatible license,
the situation is like linking in any other way with a GPL-incompatible
library.  Which implies that:</p>
<ol>
  <li>If you are writing code and releasing it under the GPL, you can
  state an explicit exception giving permission to link it with those
  GPL-incompatible facilities.</li>

  <li>If you wrote and released the program under the GPL, and you
  designed it specifically to work with those facilities, people can
  take that as an implicit exception permitting them to link it with
  those facilities.  But if that is what you intend, it is better
  to say so explicitly.</li>

  <li>You can't take someone else's GPL-covered code and use it that
  way, or add such exceptions to it.  Only the copyright holders of that
  code can add the exception.</li>
</ol>
<p></p></dd>

<dt><b><a href="#TOCWhoHasThePower" name="WhoHasThePower">Who has the
power to enforce the GPL?</a></b></dt>

<dd>
Since the GPL is a copyright license, the copyright holders of the
software are the ones who have the power to enforce the GPL.  If you
see a violation of the GPL, you should inform the developers of the
GPL-covered software involved.  They either are the copyright holders,
or are connected with the copyright holders.  <a href="http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#ReportingViolation">Learn

Subclassing is creating a derivative work.  Therefore, the terms of the
GPL affect the whole program where you create a subclass of a GPL'ed
class.

<dt><b><a href="#TOCPortProgramToGL" name="PortProgramToGL">If I port
my program to GNU/Linux, does that mean I have to release it as Free
Software under the GPL or some other Free Software license?</a></b></dt>

<dd>
In general, the answer is no--this is not a legal requirement.  In
specific, the answer depends on which libraries you want to use and what
their licenses are.  Most system libraries either use the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">GNU Lesser GPL</a>, or use the GNU GPL plus an
exception permitting linking the library with anything.  These libraries
can be used in non-free programs; but in the case of the Lesser GPL, it
does have some requirements you must follow.
<p>
Some libraries are released under the GNU GPL alone; you must use a
GPL-compatible license to use those libraries.  But these are normally
the more specialized libraries, and you would not have had anything much
like them on another platform, so you probably won't find yourself
wanting to use these libraries for simple porting.</p>
<p>
Of course, your software is not a contribution to our community if it is
not free, and people who value their freedom will refuse to use it.
Only people willing to give up their freedom will use your software,
which means that it will effectively function as an inducement for people
to lose their freedom.</p>
<p>
If you hope some day to look back on your career and feel that
it has contributed to the growth of a good and free society, you
need to make your software free.

<dt><b><a href="#TOCCompanyGPLCostsMoney" name="CompanyGPLCostsMoney">
I just found out that a company has a copy of a GPL'ed program, and it
costs money to get it.  Aren't they violating the GPL by not making it
available on the Internet?</a></b></dt>

<dd>
No.  The GPL does not require anyone to use the Internet for
distribution.  It also does not require anyone in particular to
redistribute the program.  And (outside of one special case), even if
someone does decide to redistribute the program sometimes, the GPL
doesn't say he has to distribute a copy to you in particular, or any
other person in particular.
<p>
What the GPL requires is that he must have the freedom to distribute a
copy to you <em>if he wishes to</em>.  Once the copyright holder does
distribute a copy program to someone, that someone can then redistribute
the program to you, or to anyone else, as he sees fit.

<dt><b><a href="#TOCReleaseNotOriginal" name="ReleaseNotOriginal"> Can
I release a program with a license which says that you can distribute
modified versions of it under the GPL but you can't distribute the
original itself under the GPL?</a></b></dt>

<dd>
No.  Such a license would be self-contradictory.  Let's look at its 
implications for me as a user. 
<p>
Suppose I start with the original version (call it version A), add 
some code (let's imagine it is 1000 lines), and release that modified 
version (call it B) under the GPL.  The GPL says anyone can change 
version B again and release the result under the GPL.  So I (or 
someone else) can delete those 1000 lines, producing version C which 
has the same code as version A but is under the GPL.</p>
<p>
If you try to block that path, by saying explicitly in the license that 
I'm not allowed to reproduce something identical to version A under 
the GPL by deleting those lines from version B, in effect the license 
now says that I can't fully use version B in all the ways that the GPL 
permits.  In other words, the license does not in fact allow a user to 
release a modified version such as B under the GPL.
