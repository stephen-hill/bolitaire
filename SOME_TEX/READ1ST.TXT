There are three easter eggs which can be invoked by pressing F2 at some place, In which one is a different game where all the cards are hidden and you can see the cards when only you move it.       



Installation :
---------------

    Windows user simply run the setup file if you download setup file. If you 
got a zip file then extract it to a folder and run bolitaire.exe. if it asks
for alleg41.dll download it and extract it to drive:/windows/system.    


    To create the boot floppy you need boot_fd_bolitaire.imz and a floppy, 
then extract these files to a fresh floppy using softwares like WinImage or 
folppyimage(freeware). Now, boot with that floppy to enjoy freecell.


    Dos users unzip the program to a seperate folder,then execute the program 
from there. you will require mouse(like cute mouse) support for dos. You will
also need cwsdpmi if you run bolitaire in real mode dos (ie DOS as OS and not
dos box or command prompt)

there. If it asks for liballeg.so.4.1 then download it and copy it to 
/usr/local/lib or /usr/lib.


    BeOS user unzip the program to a seperate folder, then execute bolitaire from
there. If it asks for liballeg.so.4.1(for BeOS) then download it and copy it to
